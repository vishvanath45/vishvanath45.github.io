<h3 id="some-quotes-which-inspire-me"><em>Some quotes which inspire me</em></h3>

<p>Who is rich? he that is content.</p>

<p>Who is wise? he who learns from everyone.</p>

<p>You may delay, but time will not.</p>

<p>When the well‚Äôs dry, we know the worth of water.</p>

<p>Help yourself so you can help others,Put the oxygen mask on.</p>

<p>This I have seen in life‚Äîthose who are overcautious about themselves fall into dangers at every step; those who are afraid of losing honour and respect, get only disgrace; and those who are always afraid of loss, always lose.</p>
