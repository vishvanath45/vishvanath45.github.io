### _Some quotes which inspire me_ 

> Who is wise? he who learns from everyone.  

> You may delay, but time will not.  

> When the well's dry, we know the worth of water.  

> Help yourself so you can help others,Put the oxygen mask on.  

> This I have seen in life—those who are overcautious about themselves fall into dangers at every step; those who are afraid of losing honour and respect, get only disgrace; and those who are always afraid of loss, always lose.

> Greatest threat to success is not failure, it's boredom.

> Honing one's craft is boring.

> Doing this faster and faiing is better than not doing or being slow in taking decisions.

> Who is rich? he that is content.  

### _Books I am currently reading (Jan'21)_

> Creative Selection
