### _Some quotes which inspire me_- 

Who is rich? he that is content.  

Who is wise? he who learns from everyone.  

You may delay, but time will not.  

When the well's dry, we know the worth of water.  

Help yourself so you can help others,Put the oxygen mask on.  

This I have seen in life‚Äîthose who are overcautious about themselves fall into dangers at every step; those who are afraid of losing honour and respect, get only disgrace; and those who are always afraid of loss, always lose.
